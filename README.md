# free-agent-web

A Quil sketch that animates circle collisions.  They get stuck together sometimes, other times not.  They get big and angry when they're stuck together.

## Usage

LightTable - open `core.clj` and press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` to evaluate the file.

Emacs - run cider, open `core.clj` and press `C-c C-k` to evaluate the file.

REPL - run `(require 'free-agent-web.core)`.

Leiningen - main is defined, so "lein run" will cause the sketch to run as a side effect.
